# About the project
This idea started after I choose my university final year project and I learned that Microsoft has developed a new file system that removes some limitations that NTFS has and deals better with data corruption. After looking around to see if there are any tools or pieces of software 

The project is aiming to fit the needs of a day-to-day user and help out in data loss recovery, also I want to build a robust, powerful, and easy-to-use framework for forensic applications in which the logical/physical forensic image is formatted with ReFS.

# Giving credit where credit is due
This project wouldn't be possible or would be really hard to accomplish without the help of a paper written by Paul Prade, Tobias GroÃŸ, Andreas Dewald from Friedrich Alexander University
Erlangen-Nuremberg. Please feel free to go and read their amazing paper here -> https://doi.org/10.25593/issn.2191-5008/CS-2019-05

# Current capabilities
- The ability to correctly parse and output information from the following:
    - Boot sector
    - Superblock
    - Checkpoint
    - Nodes

# Usage
To display general information about the forensic image you will need to pass the -ii or --image_info flags. See the example bellow:
```cmd
$> py main.py -f path/to/file.001 -ii

<<=====================[Boot Sector]=====================>>
[+] ReFS Version: 3.4
[+] Super Block Offset: 1966080 bytes
[+] VBR Size: 512 bytes

[+] Volume Serial Number: 7EBA2960BA2915E5

```

At this stage in development the tool is able to parse the data found in the Superblock, Checkpoint and individual Table Nodes but I didn't implement a flag that allows you to view data by passing a offset to a node yet. 
As I said, in the mean time, please use the bellow command to get the information stored in the Superblock:

```cmd
$> py main.py -f path/to/file.001 -bi superblock

You can do the exact same thing with the Checkpoint:
```cmd
$> py main.py -f path/to/file.001 -bi superblock

## !! IMPORTANT !!!
I am in the process of implementing the algorithm that translates virtual-to-physical addresses used by ReFS. With that said the only usable offset from the pointers section is the Container Table and the Duplicate Container Table because they hold  the needed information for this process. 

# What's next?
- Implementing the algorithm needed to translate virtual addresses to physical ones.
- Correctly displaying the offsets of all the tables in the file system.
- Adding support for the rest of the tables in the file system.
- Implementing ways to view the files/folders present in the forensic image. (Deleted or not)
- Adding the ability to recover deleted or non-deleted files/folders from the forensic image.
